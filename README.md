Description
===========

This is an OpenStack HEAT template to deploy [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) 
to multiple servers in an OpenStack cloud. Currently, only Hortonworks HDP 1.3 
has been tested. Support for Apache Hadoop and Cloudera CDH distros and Hadoop 
YARN may be added in the future.

This template uses [hadoop salt-formulas](https://github.com/rcbops/hadoop-formula) 
to configure the servers. It deploys a salt-master, and a number of salt-minions. 
One minion will be the Hadoop master node. Rest of the minions will be Hadoop data 
nodes. The number of data nodes can be specified during the stack creation. 

For access to nodes in the Hadoop cluster, a floating ip will be assigned to the 
salt-master. Or a new server can be created in the same network as the Hadoop network.

Any changes to the Hadoop configuration can be done using Salt pillars on the Salt 
master. Adding or decommissioning datanodes can be done via Salt as well.

Requirements
============
* A Heat provider that supports the following:
  * OS::Neutron::Net
  * OS::Neutron::Subnet
  * OS::Neutron::Router
  * OS::Neutron::RouterInterface
  * OS::Neutron::FloatingIP
  * OS::Neutron::FloatingIPAssociation
  * OS::Neutron::Port
  * OS::Heat::SoftwareConfig
  * OS::Heat::SoftwareDeployment
  * OS::Heat::RandomString
  * OS::Heat::ResourceGroup
  * OS::Nova::Server
  * OS::Nova::KeyPair

* An Ubuntu image (12.04 or newer) preconfigured with heat-cfntools and heat config-script. 
Instructions for creating a heat-cfntools enabled image for use with Heat can be 
found [here] (http://docs.openstack.org/developer/heat/getting_started/jeos_building.html).

* An OpenStack username, password, and tenant id.
* [python-heatclient](https://github.com/openstack/python-heatclient)
`>= v0.2.12`:

```bash
pip install python-heatclient
```
Heat-client Usage
=============
Here is an example of how to deploy this template using the
[python-heatclient](https://github.com/openstack/python-heatclient):

```
heat stack-create hadoop-stack -f hadoop-stack.yaml \
  -e env.yaml -P flavor=m1.large;floating-network-id=<NET_ID>; \
  datanodes-count=<COUNT>;keyname=<KEYNAME>;image=<IMAGE_ID>
```

Using Horizon
=============
You can also go to your Horizon Dashboard in your browser and create 
the Hadoop stack from under the Orchestration tab.

name: Hadoop
release: 1.0

short_desc: | 
  RPC-Heat-HDP provides a template to deploy Hadoop to a cluster of servers using the Heat orchestration engine available in any Rackspace OpenStack Private Cloud.

long_desc: |
  Apache Hadoop is a popular open source framework thats allows for distributed processing of massive data sets across clusters of servers. Hadoop is designed to scale horizontally from a single server to thousands of servers, each offering its local compute and stroage, and that makes Hadoop a very good fit for OpenStack.

architecture: |
  Designing, architecting, installing and configuring a Hadoop cluster for production use cases can get very complicated. This template uses the best practices for installing and managing Hadoop within an OpenStack cloud.

  We chose to start with Hortonworks HDP 1.3 in this solution template becaues of its ubiquity across the Enterpise. Any existing workload could be ported to this deployment. Every Big Data application uses different add-on services specific to their cases. But HDFS and Map Reduce are core to all Big Data applications. For these reasons, this template focuses on providing reliable, scalable, and automated HDFS and Map Reduce.

design_specs: |
- The template sets up a Hadoop master with Name Node and Job Tracker services with a configurable amount of Hadoop workers, each having a Data Node and Task Tracker.
- Any change in configuration values or adding new Worker Nodes can be managed through SaltStack for ease of administration.
- The templates use HortonWorks HDP 1.3, but they can be easily modified to install either Apache Hadoop or Cloudera CDH.

questions:
- keyname: Choose an SSH keypair for access to the Salt Master.
- image: Choose an image every instance in the stack will use..
- floating-network-id: Choose an external network.
- datanodes-count: Choose the number of data nodes in the Hadoop cluster.
- flavor: Choose the flavor every instance in the stack will use..

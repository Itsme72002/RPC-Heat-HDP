short_desc: | 
  RPC-Heat-HDP delivers a deployable configuration of Hadoop to a cluster of servers using OpenStack Orchestration (heat) that is available in any Rackspace OpenStack Private Cloud.

long_desc: |
  Apache Hadoop is a popular open source framework thats allows for distributed processing of massive data sets across clusters of servers. Hadoop is designed to scale horizontally from a single server to thousands of servers, each offering its local compute and storage, making Hadoop a very good fit for OpenStack.

architecture: |
  Designing, architecting, installing, and configuring a Hadoop cluster for production use cases can get very complicated. This template uses the best practices for installing and managing Hadoop within an OpenStack cloud.

  We are starting with Hortonworks HDP 1.3 in this solution template because of its ubiquity across the Enterprise. Any existing workload can be ported to this deployment. Every Big Data application uses different add-on services specific to their cases. But HDFS and Map Reduce are core to all Big Data applications. For these reasons, this template focuses on providing reliable, scalable, and automated HDFS and Map Reduce.

design_specs:
- Sets up a Hadoop master with Name Node and Job Tracker services with a configurable amount of Hadoop workers, each having a Data Node and Task Tracker.
- Changes in configuration values or adding new Worker Nodes can be managed through SaltStack for ease of administration.
- Uses HortonWorks HDP 1.3, but can be easily modified to install either Apache Hadoop or Cloudera CDH.
